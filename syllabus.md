## Syllabus

### Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
* describe and explain what robots are and what they can do
* describe mathematically the position and orientation of objects and how they move 
* Develop a control architecture for a mobile robotic system 
* Implement navigation and localization algorithms based on sensor fusion and environment representation 
* Write moderately involved programs in Python to control a robotic system 
* Construct, program, and test the operation of a robotic system to perform a speciﬁed task. 

### Prerequisites
The only formal prerequisite is CS1332 Data Structures & Algorithms. Prior knowledge of fundamentals of linear algebra and probability is helpful, but not required.  Background in AI and Machine Learning is not assumed.
The course requires access to a laptop.  If you don’t have access to a laptop, please contact the instructor ASAP.  All programming assignments will be completed in Python.

### Grading
This course is heavily project-based. In addition to projects, there will be seven short quizzes. We'll drop the two lowest quiz scores, so that only five of the quizzes will count toward your grade.

The grading distribution is:

| Component     | Nr. | Grade | Total |
|---------------|-----|-------|-------|
| Projects      | 7   | 10%   |  70%  |
| Quizzes       | 7/5 | 6%    |  30%  |
|---------------|-----|-------|-------|
|               |     |       | 100%  |

The Late policy for this course will be 20% per day late, as clarified on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/jzehgqjjgpz6bb?cid=13).

Because we drop the lowest two quiz scores, we will not give make-up quizzes for class absences (even if these would normally be excused absences).  If you miss a quiz, that quiz score will be dropped as one of your two lowest quiz scores.

### Academic Integrity
Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. This includes cheating, lying about course matters, plagiarism, or helping others commit a violation of the Honor Code. Plagiarism includes reproducing the words of others without both the use of quotation marks and citation. Students are reminded of the obligations and expectations associated with the Georgia Tech Academic Honor Code and Student Code of Conduct, available online at www.honor.gatech.edu. For quizzes, no supporting materials are allowed (notes, calculators, phones, etc).

You are expected to implement the core components of each project on your own, but the extra credit opportunties often build on third party data sets or code. That's fine. Feel free to include results built on other software, as long as you are clear in your handin that it is not your own work.

You should not view or edit anyone else's code. You should not post code to Piazza, except for starter code / helper code that isn't related to the core project.

### Learning Accommodations
If needed, we will make classroom accommodations for students with documented disabilities. These accommodations must be arranged in advance and in accordance with the ADAPTS office (www.adapts.gatech.edu).

### Important Links:
* [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/k4cyzsfk7j55i6). This should be your first stop for questions and announcements.
* [canvas.gatech.edu](https://canvas.gatech.edu/) will be used to hand in assignments.

### Contact Info and Office Hours:
If possible, please use Piazza to ask questions and seek clarifications before emailing the instructor or staff.

The TA Office hour will the held in the Robotics Lab i.e. Room 030 in the College of Computing building. The hours can be found here:
