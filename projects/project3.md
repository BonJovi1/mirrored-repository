# Project 3

You'll be using your DuckieBot for this project and working with your partner!

Project 3 has two parts:
## Part 1
[Due Date: Monday, February 17, 2020 @ 11:59 P.M.]  
Follow the instructions and complete the assignment found here: [Assignment Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1znPlrqSMftHrm2k9HhnkievFaLqzFAM1)  
You will program the SD card for your duckiebot using a Virtual Machine installed on your system and configure the Duckiebot network. You will make your duckiebot move in circles. This part will ensure that your duckiebot is properly setup and can run your code.  
Please note that we recommend students complete Part 1 before Part 2 is released (i.e. February 10). This will give us time to resolve any networking issues you may face in Part 1 and it will you give you sufficient time to finish Part 2 in time.  

## Part 2
[Due Date: Monday, February 17, 2020 @ 11:59 P.M.]  
This part will be released on February 10.
